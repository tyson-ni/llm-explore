    -- Example Answer --
    There have been several significant scientific and engineering discoveries recently. In the field of artificial intelligence (AI), new tools are being developed rapidly across various sciences, accelerating the 
    pace of breakthroughs in areas such as protein discovery and battery technology  In quantum computing, Atom Computing has announced a record-breaking 1,225-qubit
    quantum computer.

    In the field of neuroscience, scientists have built the largest-ever map of the human brain, which could help 
    explain abilities like language and vulnerabilities like Alzheimer's disease  In the realm of space technology, there have been breakthroughs in satellite 
    tech that harness the sun's power Lastly, in the field of nanotechnology, the 2023 Nobel Prize for chemistry 
    recognized the power of this technology
