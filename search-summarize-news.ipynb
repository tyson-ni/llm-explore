       "Putin's regime has been profoundly shaken after the coup attempt by the Wagner mercenary company and its leader, Yevgeny Prigozhin. While Putin has tried to show that he is firmly in control, Russia's elite is unsure of his actual level of control. The Kremlin has released footage of Putin being greeted by adoring crowds in the street and attending a tech exhibition for Russian companies in Moscow, but there is ongoing debate about the stability of his rule. Some experts argue that Putin's rule was never truly threatened, but Putin's actions suggest otherwise. \n",
